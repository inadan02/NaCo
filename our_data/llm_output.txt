It was on a particularly temperate morning, the sort which invites all manner of speculative thought, that Miss Clara Ellison, seated by the parlour window with her embroidery idle in her lap, turned to her cousin with a countenance animated more by curiosity than enthusiasm.

“You have heard, I suppose, of the assembly at Hartleigh Hall next Thursday?” she inquired, affecting indifference though her gaze betrayed the eagerness of one who dearly loved a well-attended gathering.

Miss Lydia Wentworth, who had for the last ten minutes been occupied in trimming her bonnet with a ribbon too bright for general approval, raised her eyes with a smile both knowing and mischievous. “Indeed I have, Clara, and if the reports are to be credited, it promises to be more than usually well-favoured. Lady Fenwick has declared her intention of attending, and she never stirs unless the company be of consequence.”

Clara gave a small laugh, more dry than merry. “Lady Fenwick’s presence may lend the event gravity, but I doubt it will lend it spirit. I much prefer an assembly where the music is tolerable and the conversation not too encumbered by pride. Though, I confess, I am curious to see whether Mr. Everly will make good on his promise to attend. He dances tolerably well, and speaks tolerably better.”

“Ah, Mr. Everly,” Lydia repeated, her tone arch. “You would not be so sparing in praise if he had addressed his compliments to me instead of you. But do not trouble yourself — there will be no shortage of eligible partners. I shall wear my green muslin, for it is the only one that renders me tall enough to discourage Captain Ridgeway’s attentions. He is forever talking of hounds and hunting, and I would far rather hear of poetry and proposals.”

Clara smiled, but did not answer directly. She resumed her stitching with a serenity which suggested that, for all her cousin’s banter, her own thoughts were fixed not on green muslin or even eligible partners, but rather on something — or someone — that neither of them had yet named aloud.

The silence, broken only by the gentle clink of needle against thimble, was not long sustained. Lydia, whose patience seldom survived five minutes of quiet, suddenly straightened with a start of recollection.

“Oh! I had nearly forgot. A letter arrived this morning—addressed to you, but delivered first to Papa by mistake. I do believe it has occasioned a great deal more discussion than its contents deserve.”

Clara looked up at once, a faint crease of concern forming on her brow. “A letter? And from whom?”

“Well, that is precisely the source of confusion. It is signed only with the initial ‘H.’ Papa was inclined to believe it must be from Mr. Hensley, on account of the handwriting, but Mama insists it is Mr. Hawthorne’s — she says no one else would express themselves with such anxious civility.” Lydia produced the folded paper from her reticule with theatrical flair. “I took the liberty of reading it, for I was assured it could be nothing improper.”

Clara accepted the letter with a mixture of gratitude and apprehension, her eyes moving swiftly over the page. As she read, her countenance shifted — not with alarm, but with perplexity. “It is not Mr. Hensley’s hand, nor Mr. Hawthorne’s. And it speaks of arrangements and obligations I do not comprehend — ‘the terms being agreed upon,’ ‘the matter settled before the week’s end’ — but what terms? What matter?”

Lydia, who had now taken up a biscuit in lieu of the bonnet, gave a shrug half innocent, half amused. “It is rather too serious for courtship and far too vague for business. Perhaps you are about to inherit a great estate from an unknown relative. That sort of thing occurs quite frequently in novels, you know.”

Clara folded the letter with deliberation and set it on the table between them. “I shall write to Mr. Everly. He may know something of this—he is a friend to both the gentlemen in question, and far more exacting in detail than Lydia Wentworth.”

“I take no offence,” said Lydia lightly. “Men are made to explain letters and women to inspire them. Though I must say, this one lacks poetry.”
